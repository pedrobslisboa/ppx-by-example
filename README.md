## PPX by examples

:warning: **This repository is a work in progress.** :warning:

This repository contains examples to help on understanding what are and how to write PPXs in OCaml and for it we are going to use PPXLib.

On my ppx learning journey, I'm having some difficulties to find examples and explanations about how to write a PPX. So, I decided to create this repository to help others that are in the same situation as me, and also push me into learning more about it. 

So as I said, I'm learning, and I'm not an expert on the subject. If you find any mistake or have any suggestion, please open an issue or a pull request. I'll be glad to receive your feedback.
